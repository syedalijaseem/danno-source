 * 2D transformation matrix object initialized with identity matrix.
 *
 * The matrix can synchronize a canvas 2D context by supplying the context
 * as an argument, or later apply current absolute transform to an
 * existing context.
 *
 * To synchronize a DOM element you can use [`toCSS()`]{@link Matrix#toCSS} or [`toCSS3D()`]{@link Matrix#toCSS3D}.
 * together with for example the `style.transform` property.
 *
 * @param {CanvasRenderingContext2D} [context] - Optional context to sync with Matrix
 * @param {HTMLElement} [element=null] - DOM Element to synchronize
 * @prop {number} a - scale x
 * @prop {number} b - shear y
 * @prop {number} c - shear x
 * @prop {number} d - scale y
 * @prop {number} e - translate x
 * @prop {number} f - translate y
 * @prop {CanvasRenderingContext2D} [context] - set or get current synchronized 2D context
 * @prop {HTMLElement} [element] - get current synchronized DOM element
 * @prop {boolean} [useCSS3D=false] - is a DOM element is defined for sync., choose whether to use 2D (false) or 3D (true) matrix to sync it.
